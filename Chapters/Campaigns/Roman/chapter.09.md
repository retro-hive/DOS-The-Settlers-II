# CHAPTER IX: THE GREY ISLAND

Your journey has brought you to the wasteland again. Nothing around you but
desolate land and foul smells. Your only hope is reaching the gateway...


> Once again we find ourselves in a world that consists of  ash and lava.
> The atmosphere carries the putrid smell of sulphur.  It  all originates
> from the nearby volcano which bellows out its vile contents across  the
> land. My men are insisting we leave soon; I can only hope that the gods
> will guide our steps.

This level isn't quite simple,  but it's not that hard.  You have plenty of
time to build up your settlement.  Again, you face two enemies.  This time,
they both are Japanese... and they both are against you.

The map may seem tricky but it's not. Slowly make your way to the east. Use
all the mountains  that  you  come  across and prepare for an assault. I've
heard that  it's possible to build a harbor and send an expedition. I never
tried it.

This is a pretty straight-forward chapter. There are no riddles or secrets,
and there isn't someone who'll come and attack you in the first few minutes
of the game.  You have all the time in the world and all the space to do it
in... mostly.

Defeat the two adversaries and claim the gateway. It lies in the south-east
corner of the map.


> We have found the gateway and occupied it. Let us remain here no longer
> than is necessary.


Wow! ...now I have to say: wow! I didn't think you'd make it this far. When
I first started writing the FAQ, I got e-mails from people who  were  still
at chapter eight... and now,  look at you!  You made it way past nine! Rome
is getting  ever more closer.  Step through the gateway and start the final
adventure!
