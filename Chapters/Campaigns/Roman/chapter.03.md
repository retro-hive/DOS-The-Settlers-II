# CHAPTER III: THE PASS

Welcome to the third chapter of Settlers II. In this mission you will learn
how to deal with dangerous enemies and more.  First off,  Octavius has some
news...

Don't worry.  The hostile tribe of Nubians is a  long way from you and they
won't do anything... yet.  As a matter of  fact,  there  are  two  separate
tribes of Nubians. One's red and the other  one's yellow.  What you have to
do now is expand.

Build  a basic  settlement consisting of the always-present woodcutter  and
the  sawmill,  quarry,  forester  and so on.  Also,  start  expanding  your
territory to  the north and east.  Pretty soon,  you'll  bump  into  a  few
mountains.  I  counted  about  four of them, two in the east and two in the
north.  One of the mountains located to the north of your starting position
has (to the west) another (smaller) ridge.  That is where  most of the gold
is.

Continue pressing on to  the north until you reach the sea, then keep going
east.

If you advance even more, you'll stumble across the second tribe...


> Diary of Octavius, First Day of the Second Month of the 4th Year
>    
> The tribe  in the north  is blocking our  path to another gateway. They
> also regard it as their holy relic.  We  have  no  alternative  but  to
> fight. Obtain access to the gateway in the north.


The way is now clear. Neither of the two tribes will attack you first. But,
once you attack one of them,  both will come after you.  And they both have
a big army with many well-trained soldiers.  To defeat them, you must build
an even stronger army and train even more soldiers.

DO NOT attack any of them now.  You  need more time.  Mine  EVERY  mountain
on the island. Mine every little inch of land!  Bleed it dry.  And when you
think that there is nothing left to do, mine even more.

When  all the  resources have been used up,  you are finally ready.  As you
probably have already figured out,  the gateway is to the north east of the
island,  blocked by the  northern tribe.  There is no reason  to attack the
southern guys, so just leave them alone and concentrate ALL your attacks up
north.

The battle will be harsh, and you will probably lose a lot of soldiers, but
after a while you will prevail. The battle will be yours.
