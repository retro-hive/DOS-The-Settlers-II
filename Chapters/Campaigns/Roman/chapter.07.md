# CHAPTER VII: THE SNAKE

This level is really going to be a pain.  Prepare yourself for another gut-
wrenching ride  through the  Settlers world.  Chapter seven  is desigend to
break down your whole perspective on the game.

Until now, the game has been relatively easy.  A few  close-calls here  and
there, but none-the-less easy.  All the levels were designed to  give you a
fair chance  of winning,  and you seemed  to take  full advantage  of it...
until now.

Build  up  your settlement.  Establish a decent  wood production  and start
advancing south. You'll come across a thick layer of trees laced with stone
that  are  going to  have to be  dispatched of. Cut  the trees  down, build
quarries to take care of the stone and continue advancing south.

The level faces you with two enemies that you're going to meet pretty soon.
A yellow player to the right and a red player to the left; both Vikings and
both very dangerous.

To the east, masked by mountains and sea, lies the  yellow player.  He is a
strong fighter with lots of trained  soldiers thanks to  the supply of gold
he found near his H.Q.

The  red player is not so close...  you're going to  have to  advance  some
distance to reach him  in  the  west.  He is GREATLY fortified and a direct
attack on him  would mean certain death for you. He has your gateway. After
some time you will find him  and by using the 'catapult' strategy, you will
decimate his army quietly.

The game will procede as normal.  None of the computer players will attack,
so you have the time to  build up your army.  Mine all the mountains to get
the coal and iron but DO NOT  use it all up.  Remember to save some coal by
stopping the Iron Smelter's production. Why? Because the mint will need it.
The only thing that's  missing is the gold.  When you advance enough to the
west, Octavius will let you in on where the gold is.

Yup, you guessed it.  There's your gold.  Steadily advance using  the  over
popular 'catapult' strategy  and start mining like there's no tomorrow.  If
you were a smart guy and  saved up some coal,  you now have enough coins to
train all your soldiers.

Before attacking,  make  sure you build one  fortress at  the edge  of your
border with the yellow  player.  He doesn't have the  gateway so you  won't
need to attack him,  but when you attack the red player,  our yellow friend
will  start  attacking.  He  won't  do  much  damage  if  you  placed  your
fortifications right.

Now you are ready to take on the red player. Hopefully,  a big part of  his
army  was  decimated by your catapults, so you will be able to take him out
without much of a battle.  Advance to the west and a bit south and there it
is... the gateway.
