# CHAPTER X: THE LAST GATE

This is it!  The last chapter.  The  final  island and the last gate you're
going to face.  As always,  Octavius comes on...  but this time,  he's more
enthusiastic about it.


> The air is filled with anticipation and even a little reluctance, as we
> prepare to  embark on the final  and most dangerous chapter of our long
> journey home.  Will we ever see Rome again?  We  must  summon  all  our
> strength because this island seems to be our best chance...


The  tenth  and  final  chapter  puts  you in front of two enemies: red and
yellow. The first one you're going to have to worry about is red.  You have
some time before he advances down to your position, but when he does, he'll
attack without warning and tear through your territory.

What you have to do now is prepare for that attack.  Start  doing the basic
settlement thing and slowly move  to  the  north-west.  When  you reach the
mountain, don't waste any time! You don't have a big army so  you  need  to
improve it. Get a few mines working and start making soldiers.

If  you  advance  enough  to  the  north-west, you're gonna meet the yellow
player...

The yellow player is NOT aggressive towards you, only the  red  player  is.
When you attack red, yellow will come to his rescue and vice-versa. Ummm...
actually, the red player will attack you no matter what you do.

If you're good at Settlers, and you must be by now,  you'll  manage to keep
the  red  player at bay WITHOUT attacking him directly. Use the  'catapult'
strategy  and  concentrate  on  getting  as  close  to the yellow player as
possible.

Mine all the mountains (even those to the west...  the  mountain  range  is
shaped like a horseshoe) and build up your army. There's plenty of gold and
coal, so  that's  not going to be a problem. When you think you're ready to
take  on  the might of the Roman empire? ...well, just a very small part of
it?

The yellow computer player has a lot of catapults built up,  so you have to
speed  up  your  attacks.  Go  straight  through his territory, stoping for
nothing.  Fast and swift. Head on north-east after entering  the  horseshoe
mountain range and you'll soon bump into the final gateway.

Many people have failed where you have just succeeded. No need to thank me.
You did it all.  You are the  Settlers master!  Go to Rome  and claim  that
which is yours. You have just finished The Settlers II. Congratulations!
