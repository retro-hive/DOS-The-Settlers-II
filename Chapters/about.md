# About the game

The Settlers II is a strategy/economy game.  It features real-time resource
management  coupled with a  well-designed economy system that can rival any
of today's  3D management sim.  Another  important part of  the game is the
unique fighting technology.

Unlike other sims, where you get to build and provide an army but never get
to use it, in Settlers II you get to conquer enemy territory as ruthless as
possible.  An entricate  system allows  the game  to  function as a  whole,
uniting both types of gameplay into one package.

Is Settlers II a tactical real-time strategy game? Or is it an economy sim?
Like I said before: both game genres beautifully merged into one.

To succeed in the world of Settlers you will need to understand the system.
To build and train soldiers, you'll need a steady economy and ways to train
them. Shields, swords, beer and gold are just a small part of  the numerous
requirements that you're going to have to fulfill.

Brace  yourself for a ride unlike any other.  And belive me when I say that
this will be a  long ride.  Only one chapter  of the game  can run for more
than 15 hours. No. Don't even think it. The Settlers II is not a slow game!
The game is carefully  balanced to provide the best gameplay,  even at such
seemingly long play-times.

Another aspect I must point out is the graphics. It is obvious that it does
not  live up to  today's 3D  high-tech souped-up  ultra graphics, but for a
production year of 1996, it really holds its own! 1024x768 hand-drawn frame
by frame animations really make this game a technological marvel.

Play this game, understand it... and you will soon love it.
