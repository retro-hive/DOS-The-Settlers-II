Advanced Settling
=================

To better control your world and  industries,  you are given the  chance to
survey  and adapt  them to your  needs.  This can be  achieved at the "Main
Selection" menu (bottom, second button from the left).  Here's what you can
do:


Distribution Of Goods
---------------------

.. list-table:: Detailed Information

  * - Goods
    - description
  * - Foodstuff
    - Here you can decide: Where is the food taken? Which mines get the most of it?
  * - Grain
    - There are several industries based on grain. Here you can chose how much grain each of them gets.
  * - Iron
    - | Both  the Armory and the Metalworks  require  iron made in the  Iron
        Smelter.  You can chose which of them gets more.  IMPORTANT:  Always
        give  the  iron to  the Armory!  Only supply the Metalworks if  it's
        absolutely needed!
  * - Coal
    - | One of the most needed resources  is coal.  It is used to make iron,
        swords and shields and gold coins. IMPORTANT: When available, always
        get the coal to the Mint!
  * - Boards
    - | A basic need of the settlement is wood. Processed lumber is needed
        by the Metalworks  as well as the Shipyard. However, it is wise to
        only supply  them when they need it.  If not,  leave  it  all  for
        construction.
  * - Water
    - | This is a pretty straight-forward requirement. Changing this is not
        needed, because it's much wiser to just build more wells.


Transport
---------

Ever notice how the carriers always know what to pick up from the ground?
There's an order of importance, of what items are needed more and should be
transported first. Here is where you make that list.

TOOLS
-----

In this menu, you can decide what tools should  be built by the Metalworks.
Here's  what you  have to choose  from: tongs,  axe, saw, pick-axe, hammer,
shovel, crucible, rod and line, scythe, cleaver, rolling pin, bow.


.. Note: | James has a bit of advice...
         |
         | 'It should be noted that if you don't like Hunters (I avoid using them)
         | then it is wise to turn off bow production on the tool production menu,
         | as they're the only ones who use them.'


MILITARY
--------

This is where you can make adjustments to all  military matters.  The upper
value  corresponds to the recruiting rate of your army.  The higher  it is,
the  more inhabitants are recruited as soldiers.  Below this is the setting
to  protect  your huts.  If this  value is set  at maximum,  your huts  are
defended  by the strongest  unit. To raise the number of attackers  leaving
your huts per attack,  choose the next setting. The number of defenders who
counter the enemy in the event of an attack is shown by the fourth display.
The  final three  values correspond to the  occupation of your  huts in the
interior, in the center of the country and on its borders.

The best idea is to max them all out. Put as many soldiers as you have;  if
you have them.


OTHER MENUS
-----------

There are some more menus present in the "Main Selection". They're all just
statistics and such. Browse through them to  see what they're for. Some are
quite useful and some are just... crap.
