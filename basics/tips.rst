General useful tips
===================

In  this section of the FAQ,  I will try to point out certain mistakes that
rookie players may come across, and help  some intermediate players go pro.

This  section addresses  people  that  have  played,  or  have  a  somewhat
adequete understanding of the game system. If you do not, just advance down
to the walkthrough, and complete the first chapters... they're a tutorial!


#. if you ever run out of wood something called "The Emergency Program" will
   get activated.  You will be notified in the messages box. This "Emergency
   Program"  gives you  enough wood and  stone to build a  woodcutter and  a
   sawmill. Just WAIT for those to be built, so that the game can continue.

#. if you find your soldiers disappearing from their chosen locations (these
   can be Barracks,  Guardhouse, Watchtower or Fortress), try looking around
   for a Catapult. These things throw stones at close military locations and
   kill a soldier per hit! To destroy a Catapult simply conquer the military
   building  next to/around it. HINT: If a  military building is  under fire
   from a catapult, you will be notified in the messages window.

#. `something's not right!  I should be getting that particular resource but
   it's not working!`.  The only real answer to this one is: you screwed up!
   The  game is fully  designed and bug-free (at least my version is). Maybe
   you should check the industry chain to see whether you missed something.

#. if  you find it that your soldiers are all  privates and the enemy's  are
   sergeants,  officers or  whatever... it means that you're gonna get  your
   ass kicked.  Soldiers will fight better, resist more and serve you better
   if they are higher in rank.  They  advance in rank if you  get them  gold
   coins. Try to make them at the Mint.

#. `a mine is exhausted. What now?' This is easy.  There are only two things
   you can do. Send a geologist there; he will analyze the mountain and tell
   you in a few  seconds if the  entire mountain is dry, or  if you  need to
   build  another mine in another location. If the geologist comes up empty,
   it means  that the mountain  has been bled dry of resources. Find another
   one! P.S. Sometimes ALL THE MOUNTAINS  are without minerals.  Also,  if a
   mine gets exhausted, DESTROY IT, so that you don't lose more food on it.

#. if  you  find  that  your  opponent  is  capturing  more and more of your
   military buildings you can HALT his attacks by building catapults.  These
   kill off his soldiers BEFORE they get a chance to get out and attack. Try
   it out. However, this will not last long.  If  he's  not  a  moron, he'll
   figure out a way to overpower your catapults. Always  PRE-BUILD your army
   to handle ALL kinds of attacks. If this is happening it's all YOUR fault!

#. if  you  have all you need to make a soldier (beer, sword, shield) but he
   is still not appearing,  remember  that you have to have A BEER, A SWORD,
   A SHIELD and A HELPER  (free guy)  in  ONE  (the same)  storehouse (H.Q.,
   storehouse, harbor). Try restricting some of them so that everything goes
   into one.

#. remember to place flags  as frequently as possible so merchandise traffic
   can go  A LOT faster. Also,  note that  flat ground is better than hills,
   which  SLOW UP your  carriers.  Always build a Donkey Breeder to speed up
   congested roads. At one flag there can be a maximum of 8 items deposited.

#. some people actually asked 'How can I attack?'.  This is because the game
   itself fails  to explain some  of the basic of actions. To attack another
   player, simply click on his military buildings. A menu appears, that lets
   you decide HOW the attack will unfold.  After that, click on "attack" and
   you'll see a battle take place.

#. if you find the game too tiersome or demanding, it means that you're some
   kind of a  retard.  Why are you asking me for advice? Delete the game and
   go to sleep.
