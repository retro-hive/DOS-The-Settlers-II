Soldiers
--------

In Settlers II, you need soldiers to expand your territories and to protect
your H.Q.  To create a soldier, you need a shield,  a sword (Armory)  and a
beer (Brewery).

In the game, there are several ranks of soldiers.  A higher ranking soldier
will fight better and resist much longer on the battlefield. Here they are:


* PRIVATE
* PRIVATE FIRST CLASS
* SERGEANT
* OFFICER
* GENERAL


To advance in ranks, the soldiers need to be supplied with gold coins. They
can be made at the Mint,  which  makes  coins  from  raw gold and coal. The
coins are then taken to military buildings, and after a while, the soldiers
in them will get promoted.


It is FAR more efficient to promote them in a fortress than a barracks  
I've sort of worked out again the table I had regarding gold coin
consumption  for  military promotion. The way it seems to work (given a
start  point of all privates) is that the first coin promotes one
soldier one step.  The second coin promotes two soldiers one step each,
the  third  three  soldiers,  the  fourth  4 soldiers. By now the first
soldier  is  a 'general',  so  the next coin promotes the next 4 by one
step. And so on. So, the table is as follows, for promotion of eighteen
privates all the way to Generals:

  * - 
    - Soldiers
    - Buildings
    - Coins per Bldg
    - Total Coins
  * - Fortress
    - 9
    - 2
    - 12
    - 24
  * - Watchtower
    - 6
    - 3
    - 9
    - 27
  * - Guardhouse
    - 3
    - 6
    - 6
    - 36
  * - Barracks
    - 2
    - 9
    - 5
    - 45

As a rule I would very rarely let gold go to the two smaller buildings,
as they are so much less efficient. A watchtower is not much less
efficient, so will not be any problem.

Civilisations/People
--------------------

Throughout the game you will be faced with the meeting of other races. They
will be  your allies or  they may be your foes.  You can tell them apart by
their  appearance, and  by the fact  that each civilisation  has their  own
buildings.

Here is the list of civilisations and their leaders:


* ROMANS: Octavius, Julius, Brutus
* VIKINGS: Erik, Knut, Olaf
* JAPANESE: Yamauchi, Tsunami, Hakirawashi
* AFRICAN: Shaka, Todo, Muga Tscha

There are NO differences between the races. The buildings and the people are the same... unfortunatley. They may  look different but the economic system is identical.
