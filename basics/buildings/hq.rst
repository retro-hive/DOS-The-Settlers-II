The H.Q.
========

The center of your settlement will always be the Headquarters. The H.Q.  is

a building,  the only building you have when you start a new  chapter/game.
From there, the settlement will start.

The H.Q. can hold virtually everything in the Settlers II world. From every
type of person (woodcutter, carpenter, stonemason, etc.) to donkeys, grain,
gold and soldiers. Everything can be stored here.

You clearly understand now that the loss of the H.Q. means a terrible blow,
even if  not fatal.  Destroying an enemy H.Q. will completely disorient him
and leave his economy crippled.

This can also happen to you, so remember to build storehouses that can take
over the role of H.Q. Also remember that when an H.Q. is destroyed, all the
merchandise that was in it will get destroyed. The people, soldiers and all
will not perish, they will run around the surrounding territory looking for
a storehouse.  If there is one IN THE NEAR VICINITY, they will be saved, if
not they will slowly DIE.

To access the H.Q., click on it. A menu will appear that reveals everything
it can hold and their amounts. There are NO LIMITS to how much  merchandise
the H.Q. can store.

Playing the game will reveal more about the H.Q. and its importance.
