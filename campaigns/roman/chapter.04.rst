Chapter IV: On The High Seas
============================

Congratulations on reaching the fourth chapter.  This is one  of  the  most
beloved missions thanks to the fact that this  is  when  you'll  start  sea
travelling.  Expeditions  will  make you reach distant islands  and enlarge
your territory. Let's begin...

          | Yesterday we met a stranger of truly frightening appearance. He is huge
            in size, has  light  blue  eyes  and glowing golden hair. Long ago in a
            Roman harbor tavern I once heard stories of such people who live in the
            far north. How did he get here? He is suspicious and refuses to talk to
            us. We  shall  treat  him  as our guest for a few days (the poor fellow
            appears to be starving). Perhaps then he will change his attitude.


Take a look around the map. Your H.Q. is in the upper-left corner.  You now
need to  build up a steady settlement. Build the already common woodcutter,
forester,  sawmill  and  such and  get a GOOD supply of boards. Expand your
territory to the east and south.

          | Well,  what  wonders  a little  generosety can achieve. The blond giant
          | told us that he is a member of a  race that calls itself the "Vikings".
          | He  says that they lived on a large island not far to the east but they
          | were  conquered  by  a  hostile tribe. His name is Erik. What a strange
          | name! If we are to believe him, he is a shipwright  by  trade. My heart
          | beats  faster at the prospect of soon being able to board a ship again,
          | hearing the waves under the keel, the cries of  the  seagulls  and  the
          | wind  in  the  sails...  But  first  we must construct a shipyard and a
          | harbor.


You must now expand to  the east. If you reached the island to the south, a
new message will appear...


.. Note:: | On a small island in the middle of  a  archipelago,  we  discovered  an
            enormous whale graveyard, in which  there  were  hundreds  of  gigantic
            skeletons.  What  an  imposing  sight.  At  first  we  were  unable  to
            understand  how  these  creatures  got  there.  Erik explained that his
            people lived off these creatures and whorshipped  them as holy animals.
          | This was why their bones were brought to this sacred  place  after they
            were caught. Erik is uneasy, he wants to leave because he is afraid  of
            the spirits of the dead creatures.


If you  have  a  steady food source (Farms, Mills, Bakers, Pig Farms, etc.)
and a good supply of boards you are ready to build a shipyard and a harbor.
The shipyard can be built  almost  anywhere,  preferably next to water. The
harbor is a little tricky; you have  to  place  it  in  certain  designated
places. You'll see these when pressing the spacebar. A symbol for a  castle
or large building with an anchor means that it's a good spot for a  harbor.

After building a harbor and the shipyard builds you A FEW (two is ok) ships
you're ready to go on your first expediton. By now,  you've found something
called a "Ship Register". That's the place where all your ships are listed,
and also the place where you'll  control  expeditions. Click on the harbor.
Notice the button on the bottom right. Click it.  Now,  the  harbor  begins
gathering materials needed for the expedition: boards, stone and a builder.
When everything is ready to go,  you will be notified in the messages  box.

Now  you're  ready  to  set  sail.  Click on the ship that's loaded up with
materials. On the left there are some arrows. Each sends the ship to  a new
locations,  pre-defined  for exploration (no, you can NOT chose ANY spot on
the map).

When you reach the place you want to settle, just hit the anchor button and
the boat will land and start building a new harbor. That's all the supplies
and manpower you brought  with  that  first  boat.  Now  start  building  a
military  building NEXT or REALLY close to the harbor. Because there are no
building materials available AFTER the new harbor is built, your boats will
start to make trips delivering the needed supplies.

When  the  military building (always build a guardhouse or better) is built
and  gets  occupied  you're ready to start the new settlement. Do and build
whatever.  The game is programmed in such a way that everything needed will
be taken by ship. It's  like  the  new settlement was directly connected to
your H.Q. Experiment with this.

Now, you should push to the east. Expand your territory as much to the east
as possible. You'll come across a few mountains, two hold coal deposits and
one has gold. Unfortunately none has iron. That's going to be a problem.

On  this  chapter, you face two enemies: yellow and red. BOTH of them are A
LOT more developed than you and both have strong military capabilities. You
won't be able to defeat them with your current army. You will need  to send
an expedition to the south island, to find the iron ore deposit so that you
can breed more soldiers. There are three islands to the  south that you can
settle. One directly down your main island, which holds a  mountain  filled
with gold, another one that's small and has  stone  deposits  and the third
and final one, which has the iron you need.

Extract  the  iron, breed over 50 soldiers, give 'em coins so that  they'll
advance  in  rank.  By  now, you should've reached the yellow player to the
east. When I played the level, I also sent an expedition to the  south-east
and reached the red player too.  Build about 10 catapults  along the border
to exterminate some of your enemies' soldiers.

Now that you have your army ready, charge in full force. Destroy the yellow
player. The red player has a better army and he will  charge  some  of your
military buildings,  but if you did what I told you,  he won't be  able  to
capture any of them.

The gateway is in the middle of the east island, between the yellow and red
player.  Normally,  it's  not  necessary to defeat the red player too, just
capture your way through, all the way to the gatway.


.. Note:: We have reached the gateway and activated it. The way is now clear.
