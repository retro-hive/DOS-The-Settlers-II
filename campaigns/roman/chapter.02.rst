Chapter II: Initial Contact
===========================

Welcome to the second island and chapter two of the Settlers II saga. First
off, you'll notice that your H.Q. looks different. Yes, you've advanced  in
technology and everything you have discovered in chapter 1 can be used.


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Third Day of the Second Year
          |
          | We have  reached a second  island which appears  to be uninhabited. The
            stock of tools belonging to the good old  Tortius is slowly  being used
            up. We desperately need a metalworks to make new tools.

This is all Octavius has to say, so we should do what he says.  But  first,
set up your settlement. Get your basic industry going: woodcutter, forester
sawmill and quarry. Put more if you want.

Now, head over to the west mountain and plant a flag. Time for a geologist.
He will tell  you that there's coal and iron to be found, so get going with
a few mines. After that, build the metalworks and iron smelter required  by
the game... but don't keep it going too long.  Despite what Octavius  says,
there are PLENTY of tools in the H.Q.

Quickly expand to the north of the map with a military building and build a
Armory to  start making swords and shields. One more thing needed  to breed
soldiers...


.. Note:: | We  advanced  a  short  distance  northward  and came  across a  fellow
          | countryman.  He was  the  only survivor  of another shipwreck and he is
          | very happy to see other humans again. We were also  pleased; the man is
          | a brewer.  If  we  ever  get  into warlike disputes, beer will lift the
          | courage of our people. A soldier needs much more than just a shield and
          | a sword!  The man also tells us of ruins that he has discovered  on the
          | island. I fear that before long we will need to be more careful.


...beer. I know it sounds strange, but that's the   way this game works. So
get up and  use your new  found land  to  get some farms  going, get a good
supply of  food going to  feed the miners  and have some  grain for the new
brewery!

Take note that there's another mountain to  the east. We will need to reach
that if we're going to build a  great army.  Why?  Well,  upon expanding in
territory, you'll come across...


.. Note:: | We  have  found  the  ruins.   They  contained  building  plans  for  a
          | watchtower. Now we should consider building fortifications.  I  am more
          | convinced than ever that we are not alone on this island.
          |
          | We  have  found  the  ruins.   They  contained  building  plans  for  a
          | watchtower. What is the origin of these  structures? Who built  them? I
          | fear that peace will soon be at an end.
          |
          | Whoever is or was on this island knows all about the building trade. We
          | found the ruins of a mighty fortress  of  exemplary  construction.  Our
          | architects have already drawn up a building plan.


By now, you should have reached the eastern mountain. Send a geologist, and
start to extract  gold,  coal,  granite and iron. Also, try to refrain from
using barracks anymore.  Build Guardhouses and Watchtowers, especially when
advancing north.


.. Note:: | Our  territory  is  expanding  and  transportation  routes are becoming
          | larger and longer.  We must  build a  storehouse so that we can respond
          | more quickly to the needs of our people.


As the diary mentiones,  you're going  to  need a storehouse. Two actually.
One on the  north side of the settlement  (try to place it as close  to the
border as possible)  and  one  on  the eastern side (again, try to build it
next to the border). If you have advanced enough north...


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, 26th Day of the Third Month of the Second Year
          |
          | My fears  have been given further confirmation. My men found a rag doll
            and  two  spear tips of the type customarily associated with the Nubian
            tribes. These artifacts do not appear very old.


...a little bit more...


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Fourth Day of the Fourth Month of the Second Year
          |
          | It  was  only  to  be  expected:  we  came across the Nubians. At first
            everything  was  friendly.  They  even told us about their relic and it
            quickly  became obvious that it was one of the gateways. They denied us
            access to their holy relic, we shall have to fight to obtain access.


...you'll  stumble  across a new civilisation:  the  Nubians.  They  are  a
friendly nation and will not attack you... untill you kill them. But before
you can assault their territory,  you  have  to  ensure  that  you  have  a
powerful army. A well-trained, numerous army.

To do this, get your Armory,  Iron Smelter and  Brewery to  work better  so
they'll produce more soldiers. However,  these  soldiers are poorly trained
and will quickly secumb to their adversaries. To train soldiers,  you  need
to pay them. Build gold mines, smelt the gold in a Mint and distribute  the
gold coins to your military  buildings, where the soldiers stationed  there
will train and advance in ranks.

Remember  to  use the deposits in the mountain on the upper-left north side
of the map.

When you have a powerful army, make an assault  on  the  Nubians'  military
buildings.  Once  such  a  building  (Barracks,  Guardhouse, Watchtower and
Fortress) is captured, the land it maintained will turn over to you.


.. Note:: | The Nubians are lousy fighters but they have a catapult which  we  must destroy.
          | Perhaps then we shall be able to capture plans showing how  to
            build such a weapon.


To  find out what a catapult  does  in  Settlers  II,  read  the  buildings
section of the FAQ (2.4).

Slowly but surely advance trough Nubian controlled  territory  towards  the
north-east side of the map. That's where you'll find the gateway.


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, 27th Day of the Ninth Month
          |
          | We were victorious in  battle and the  island is ours.  The gateway has
            become active again.  I am excited by the prospect of where our journey
            will take us now.   The inscription on the gateway is in Latin.  I hope
            that we will retrace the steps of our legendary predecessors when  they
            journeyed to Rome...

This has been your first encounter with another civilisation.  Even  though
you proved  to be the better  leader,  the upcoming  levels will have  much
more agressive and greater skilled adversaries. Be prepared!
