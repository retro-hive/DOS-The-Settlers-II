Chapter I: Off We Go
====================

Welcome  to the world of  Settlers II.  "Off We Go"  is a chapter  that  is
designed to familiarize  you with the basic  knowledge needed  to  survive.
It teaches you the basics of buildings, roads, industries and expansion.

After a few seconds,  the Diary of Octavius  will  appear on the screen. DO
NOT  CLOSE IT.  This window  appears only once and gives you information on
what you have to do next. Here's what the first one says:


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Fourth Day after Shipwreck  
          | 
          | Yesterday all the survivors met in order to discuss the situation.  
            Because there is no prospect of an early rescue, we decided to settle
            on this  foreign island. The items salvaged from the ship will  be a
            great help to us. The most important  thing is to make  use of the raw
            materials on the island in order to establish a settlement. We urgently
            need accommodations for a woodcutter, carpenter and stonemason.


Click  on  continue  and let's move on.  As Octavius  said  and  as  common
knowledge it may be, you need to get  your basic  industry  going.  Build a
woodcutter on the left, next to the trees. Then build a sawmill next to the
H.Q. Connect everything  with roads  and remember  to place  flags to  make
things go quicker. On  the right,  a  little  low,  there  are  some  stone
deposits. Build the quarry there.

After it's all built, Octavius will have some more to share with you...

.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Eight Day after Shipwreck
          | 
          | The basic requirements for building up our settlement have been met.  
            However, the supply of trees will not last long. We need a forester
            to ensure a long-term supply of timber. Build a forester.


Well, as he so delicately puts it, build a forester. Try to build it on the
upper-left side of the territory, next to the woodcutter.


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Eleventh Day of the Second Month after Shipwreck
          |
          | We  are still  not sure whether we  are the only people on this island.
            As a precautionary measue we  should  erect a  barracks on  our exposed
            border towards  the  interior of  the island.  Build a barracks  on the
            northern border of your settlement.


I guess it's pretty obvious what you have to do. Just pick a spot somewhere
north and build  a barracks.  Notice how when  it's done, the  builder will
leave and a soldier will emerge from your Headquarters and  take station in
the barracks. When he enters it, your territory will expand.


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Fifth Day of the Third Month
          |
          | Our  territory  has spread as far as  the moutain  in  the  north.  Our
          | geologist will carry  out a land survey there. In the long term we need
          | fuel and building materials as well as weapons and coined gold. We must
          | therefore find a source of iron ore,  gold, coal  and granite.  Build a
          | road to  the mountain and send your geologist there.


Again this is pretty straight-forward. You just have to build a road to the
top (!)  of the mountain  and send  a geologist.  To do that, erect a flag,
connect it to the road, then click on the flag again and click on the "call
geologist" button. In a few seconds, a yuppie grey haired old man will come
out of  your H.Q. and move to  the mountain.  He will  start to analyze the
ground.  If he  finds any mineral  deposits,  you will  be notified  in the
messages  window.  Also, he will  plant a small sign on the ground with the
symbol  (color: brown, gray, yellow and white) of  the metal that's present
there.


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Sixteenth Day of the Sixth Month
          |
          | We  have found iron ore and  are now able to produce weapons. There are
          | now no obstacles to further  exploration of  the island.  First we must
          | construct both an  iron mine  and an Iron Smelter. An armourer can then
          | start  to  produce swords and  shields. We must also provide the miners
          | with  food,  our  stocks  are  almost  exhausted. We  need  hunters and
          | fishermen.  Build an iron mine, an Iron Smelter and an Armory.

Next you have to build a mine where the geologist found the ore deposit. To
do so,  just  click on the  ground and build  the mine  just like a  normal
building. Connect it to the  road and erect flags. After the mine is built,
a miner will come and occupy it.  He will then procede to  extract iron ore
from the ground. However he can accomplish this ONLY if he is supplied with
food.

Food in the early stages of a game can be found in the ocean: fish.  A good
supply is a  fisherman, who  can remove almost 50 fish before depleting his
area.  Another answer is  the hunter who can kill every living thing around
his area and turn it into meat. This choice however is only for a very very
short-term.  In a matter  of minutes the wild-life in the area will be gone
and the hunter will be left there doing nothing.

So  build the mine, build  the Fishery  next to the  water, build the  Iron
Smelter then build the Armory.


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Last Day of the Eight Month after coming ashore
          |
          | There is  an  open, fertile  plain to the north of our new border post.
          | This   will  provide  lots  of  new  opportunities  for  expanding  our
          | settlement  but we need more soldiers to do this.  Go  to the  northern
          | plain and continue expanding the border.

It's  now  time  to  expand.  Enlarge  your  territory  by building another
barracks at the north border. Just after the barracks gets occupied and you
aquire more land, Octavius comes on...

.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Twelfth Day of the Ninth Month
          |
          | After  advancing  further north  we  have finally found enough space to
          | construct larger buildings and farms.  We now intend to search for  raw
          | materials  in the surrounding mountains.  Search for  new raw materials
          | and secure a supply of food. Explore the entire island.

Take a look at your territory. See the big empty space up north,  where you
just built  the barracks?  Well, that  should now become farming  land.  To
sustain mines, you must have food,  and the best way to  long-term  food is
the farm. However, remember that it requires SPACE AROUND IT so that it can
grow its crops!

Also, build another  barracks at the north-west part of the settlement,  up
high in the mountains. Trust me and do it.

You only have one last thing to do. Make roads to the western mountain  and
send some geologists there so that they can discover other raw materials.

What comes now is a chain reaction of findings. You'll discover coal, gold,
granite and you'll  have the chance to build bakers, mills,  pig farms  and
slaughterhouses. Here are the messages you'll recieve...


.. Note:: | Construction of our first grain farm has been completed. The grain  can
          | either  be processed into  flour in a mill,  or used to feed pigs.  The
          | food supply situation should now continue to improve.
          | 
          | The windmill can supply a baker with sufficient flour for baking bread.
          | 
          | Our new pig farm can supply animals to a butcher.
          | 
          | We have discovered a gold vein and can now produce valuable coins in  a
          | mint. This will make life here almost as comfortable as home.
          | 
          | We have mined  the first gold coins and can now pay for the training of
          | our soldiers.
          |
          | We have ensured a fuel supply for the metalworks by finding coal in the
          | western  mountains.  Now we  can  process our  metal ores  without  any
          | problems. Everything is going extremely well.
          |
          | Geologists  have found granite  deposits in the  mountains,  this  will
          | provide a fresh supply of stone for the time being.

By now you should have a Mint, a Slaughterhouse, a Pig Farm, a few Farms, a
Mill and a Bakery  built. But for the Pig Farm and Bakery to produce you'll
also need water. In Settlers II water can be obtained from Wells. Right now
you can not build a Well. To get the ability to build it, you have  to find
a  nice green  spot on  the  map (could be next to your H.Q.)  and  send  a
geologist there. He won't find gold or anything, but he'll turn up a spring
and the game will let you build a Well. You'll also get a message...


.. Note:: | Our geologist has  found a spring. We are now able to supply fres water to our settlement.

Now that  you have a good supply of food and a few working mines, it's time
to build  another quarry  next to the two stone piles to the upper right of
the map, but more important, build  another barracks to expand your land up
in the north-western part of the map.

Continue expanding your territory into the west until...


.. Note:: | Our scouts have discovered a strange  object. It  looks like a gateway.
          | We are  obviously not  the first humans on this island.  They have even
            found  an  inscription  on  the  gateway  in Latin.  It  is  bizare and
            contradictory,  perhaps  it  is a  riddle:  "Consiste ut procederas!" -
            "Settle down in order to make progress." What can this mean?


Yes, you're amazed.  I know.  Things are not what  they seem.  Danger lurks
around, but you must  press on.  Build  another  barracks  to  expand  your
territory once again.  If your  controlled territory  engulfs the  gateway,
you've done it! Here's what you get...


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius,  Second  Day of the Thirteenth  Month  after  coming ashore
          | 
          | The  second  year  began  yesterday and  we  seem  to have succeeded in
            settling this island. The  scouts  report  strange  goings on  near the
            gateway.  It  appears  that a path has opened up that can lead  us from
            this island. This seems to be the meaning of the riddle: we must settle
            in order to move on. We shall take a look, perhaps all roads really  do
            lead to Rome.

You  can now choose to enter the gate or to continue playing  on this  map.
Anyway you  choose, the chapter  is complete, and you have enabled the next
one. By entering the gate you go to the next chapter, but if you decide you
want to stay and play a little longer, you'll have to end the game manually
and then start the next chapter.

This  first mission  has been the basic tutorial of  the game,  to get  you
familiar with all the industries involved in Settlers II. This will  NOT be
dealt with in  the next  chapters! Hope you remember what you  learned 'cuz
you're gonna need it.
