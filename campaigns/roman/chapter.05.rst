Chapter V: In The Wasteland
===========================

It's time for some serious settling.  Welcome  to the fifth chapter  of the
game.  It's  a  miracle  you made it this far. Not a lot of people have the
patience for this. You seem to really like the game. Good for you.


.. Note:: | We  are  surrounded by nothing but barren wilderness. The edges of this
            world seem  to  be  either  impenetrable mountains or lava flows. It is
            impossible to  keep track of time here. A dim, perpetual twilight hangs
            over  everything  and  there  is  neither  sunlight nor starlight. What
            wonders and dangers lie hidden here?


This level is by far the worst you've encountered until now.  You  must  be

very careful on what you build, where you  build it and for what.  On  this
map you are against two other computer rivals. They have ALL the advantages
and you only  have  your  wisdom  to  defeat  them. Hopefully with my help,
you'll do fine.

Take a look at the  terrain.  Different  right? Well, this is the wasteland
mentioned in the title. Get your basic industries running. Boards and stone
are essential, especially stone which you have plenty of... but you'll soon
find out why.

Get some farms going and start making food. Expand south and secure some of
the mountains (the more the better, everything is  south).  To the west you
will see some trees engulfed  by a huge  wall  of  stone. That's one of the
ways to reach the gateway. I've read another FAQ which mentions another way
trough the east.  Supposedly,  you should advance east and reach a location
for a harbor, from where you'll launch an expedition towards the gateway. I
tired  it  but  couldn't make it work. But let's get back to the other (my)
way.

In this level, charging  your  enemy's army is foolish. They both have more
and better  trained  men. You're going to have to learn to methodically use
the  Catapult.  Settlers  II  has  provided  you  with a NON-VIOLENT way of
advancing  trough enemy territory and vaporizing his army at the same time,
without  him being  the wiser! Yes, it's true. Building a catapult close to
the  border  with  someone else, and supplying it with stone will get it to
throw  boulders at  your enemy's military buildings (only the ones in close
proximity). He loses soldiers, one by one, until the  last  one.  When  the
final rock hits the final soldier, the military building will be destroied.
And the best thing about this, is that the computer doesn't  take  this  as
aggresion, and DOES NOT ATTACK YOU. He still thinks you're best friends!

In this  chapter, you'll have to base your entire strategy on this catapult
theory. You're going to have to advance TROUGH his territory WITHOUT making
a clear attack on his buildings.  Why?  If  you would attack any one of the
two computer players,  both of  them would attack and DEFEAT you beacuse of
their big and well-trained armies.

I  hope  you understood how the catapult tactic works, 'cuz you'll need it.
You should now have a few mines going, a steady food supply and be half-way
trough piercing  the huge stone deposit to the west. Now's the time to meet
your opponents. Red first.


.. Note:: | We  have  met  humans  of  much  stranger  appearance  than  our Viking
            shipwright.  They call themselves "Sons of Nippon". They  are short and
            thin  but  obviously skilled and  tenacious. Their strangest feature is
            their  skin  color.  It  is  yellow ochre and their eyes are just small
            slits. They act in a friendly manner although  they  are  unsettling to
            behold because of thier strange appearance.


If  you  expanded your territory to the west like I told you, you'll soon
meet the yellow (and the most dangerous) opponent.


.. Note:: | The "Sons of Nippon" in the south have relatives in the north. Their
            relationship with each  other  appears very friendly. War with one race
            means war  with  the  other.  We  must  consider  the  prospect  of war
            carefully.


There isn't much more I can say about this chapter.  If  you've learned how
to do the catapult thing, you're set to win. If  not,  you'll have to learn
it because  there's  no way you can face both these opponents without using
the catapult.

Mine ALL the mountains to the south.  You'll  find  some gold (not enough),
a  lot of coal, some iron and a little granite. Your military strength (the
number  of soldiers, check the ADVANCED SETTLING section - 2.9)  should  be
near 400. The gold  production will be lacking though. You won't be able to
surpass the yellow player.

Build lots of catapults and wait.  If  you  built them right, they'll start
killing off the computer's soldiers  while  yours  stay  put.  When  you've
slaughtered enough, go and attack. It would be best if the  stone  deposits
to the west were gone, so that you could directly attack the yellow player.

Attack and attack, but do not go for total domination.  Don't  conquer  all
of your enemy's military buildings. Go straight for the gateway. Which way?
Directly west. Hopefully, you'll reach it without too much casualties.


.. Note:: | We have found the gateway and occupied it. We can go through it
            whenever we want!


Well,  if  you've  made  it  this far, you probably are a good and seasoned
player.  Settlers II is a game designed for you and you had little  trouble
adapting to it.  You're  ready  to take  on bigger  challenges!  Rome is in
your grasp!
