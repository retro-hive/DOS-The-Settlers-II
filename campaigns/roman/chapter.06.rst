Chapter VI: Divided Country
===========================

The shit finally hit  the  fan.  Welcome  to  your  worst  nightmare.  This
chapter is a real  bitch.  You start off normal,  but  Octavius  brings the
bad news to you...


.. Note:: | Diary of Octavius, Last Day of the Fifth Year
          |
          | Rock  carvings suggest there is an island in the southwest.  It appears
          | there are large gold deposits there.

The idea of the level is that everyone ALREADY IS your enemy; you gotta get
prepared for the hit. You face two enemies,  red and yellow,  both of which
have a good  supply of soldiers and gold. When starting,  you get some gold
and a few (already) trained soldiers. Why? To get you trough the first wave
of attack.

Establish  a basic settlement and  advance to the east.  The  mountain down
there is perfect  for cover against the red player.  DO NOT use guardhouses
or  barracks.  You need  serious power  against him.  Build Watchtowers and
maybe a Fortress and cover them all with lots of catapults.

It is very important to build the catapults near the military buildings for
they will be a very important part of your defense.  Build the defense wall
fast, 'cuz soon enough, it'll be put to the test.

Now build a harbour and set up an expedition for the south island which, as
Octavius said, has lots of gold... and you're gonna need it all.

By the time you get your mining done,  the red player will advance  to your
position over at the east mountain.  He will attack you without notice, but
this will  prove  to be useful in the long run.  Your  defense  wall  might
suffer,  but  don't  despair.  This is actually  the plan.  His  army  will
decimate over time while  yours quietly grows;  or  at  least  that  what's
supposed to happen.

After a while,  he'll run out of attacking soldiers. Now it's time for your
move.  Build a few catapults  right up to  your border with him.  If placed
right,  those  catapults  will  slowly kill his  soldiers stationed  in the
near-by  military buildings.  He will reinforce them with what he can,  but
after some time he'll  run out of them too... and you will be  left with an
incapacitated enemy.


.. Note:: | The Vikings have a  settlement behind the  large mountain  range on the
            east  of  our  island.  From the  peaks of  the mountains,  one can see
            another very large land  mass in the  northeast.  We have not yet found
            any trace of a gateway  and the prisoners of war  claim they know of no
            such thing,  but they  are poor liars.  We have captured the small area
            of land  beyond the mountain  chain from the  Vikings.  We took further
            prisoners who told us where the gateway is. As we already suspected, it
            is in the far northeast.  Apart from a small  area in the  south of the
            land mass, it is entirely in the hands of the Vikings.  We must quickly
            build a harbor there and acquire fresh supplies.


Time to take  the battle to them.  Now  that  your  army grew thanks to the
mining of distant islands and  his  army  destroied  by  smart  placing  of
catapults  YOU are  ready to  KICK ASS.  Rip trough his  territory  and  go
straight to the east, where you'll finally meet the yellow player.

I've  read in other FAQs that the  way you defeat  the yellow player  is by
building another  harbour and getting  to him by sea.  I never  tried it. I
always go straight  for him; always  to the east,  you can actually  get to
him.  Again, attack STRAIGHT  through his territory, towards the northeast,
where you'll find the gateway.

Puncture through his land and do it fast. If your supply  of  soldiers runs
out,  you're out  of luck.  All the resources at your  disposal are already
exhausted... and  tryin' to mine your enemy's mountains won't  do any good;
they dried it up.  Attack swift and straight.  Don't stop for anything.  Go
directly for the gateway.


.. Note:: We have found the gateway and occupied it.


Has this chapter been a  real pain in the ass? Did thoughts of quitting the
game  ever occur  to you?  Maybe you  should take a break.  Have a beer and
chill.  After a few hours,  and  possibly  a  little  sleep,  give the game
another chance. It's all for the best.
