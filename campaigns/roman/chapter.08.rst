Chapter VIII: Sea Routes
========================

Are you ready to run? You're gonna have to if you want  to  get  over  this
level!  Fortunately for you,  Octavius tries to help and warn you about the
inevitable danger...


.. Note:: | Scouts have told me of a mighty enemy in the west. We must try and stay
            here as long as possible. In an emergency we can always escape  to  the
            east or by sea...


Well,  the emergency will arrive in a few minutes.  The  map is occupied by
two computer players: yellow and red.  The yellow is the strongest and will
attack you directly in great force.

FORGET about your basic settlement and just concentrate on advancing to the
west. At a short distance, you'll stumble upon a mountain. That's the cover
you will use for the defense wall.  Build  watchtowers  and  catapults  and
prepare for a heavy assault.

In the meantime, advance eastwards and  build  up  your settlement... wood,
farms and all. The peninsula holds  iron  and  coal  so start breeding some
soldiers. Now all you need is gold.

To the south-east there is a  spot where you can build a harbor. From there
you  can  send  expeditions  to  the two other islands down south that hold
all the resources you'll need. Mine everything and strenghten your army.

When you think you have amassed  sufficient soldiers, start the attack. The
yellow player will fall pretty fast beacuse he used up most of his soldiers
when he attacked you.

Now  make  your  way to the south-west of the island, where you'll find the
gateway. Don't mind the red player, for he is just scenery.


.. Note:: We have found the gateway and  occupied it.  When  will  we  reach  our destination?


It seems that you passed another level.  Good for  you.  This  was  another
tough  chapter  that needed your fine touch. Your followers are quite proud
of  their  leader.  Everyone  is now confident that you have the ability to
lead your men back to Rome.
